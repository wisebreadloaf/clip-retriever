 
 
How It Works By means of a support cable, TENSOREX C+ exerts a constant tension on the contact wire, 
regardless of any changes in length due to temperature. The special spiral spring is firmly connected to 
two cams on the same shaft. The degree of rotation of the shaft results in a linear variable 
torque/moment, which is compensated for by the combination with the variable radius of the cam. This 
produces a constant pulling force over the entire device working range.
